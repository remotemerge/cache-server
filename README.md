CacheServer offers an API for loading webpages and returning their HTML source code. Utilizing Puppeteer behind the scenes, it launches a headless browser to fetch the content. The CacheServer API streamlines various automated tasks, such as web page extraction, data mining, and content analysis, by providing a seamless and efficient interface.

### System Requirements

CacheServer is compatible with Node.js v8 and above, although using the latest version of Node.js is highly recommended to ensure access to all features and optimal performance.

**Note:** Ensure that Node.js is properly installed and accessible in system PATH.

### Installation

To install CacheServer, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm i -g @sapkotamadan/cache-server

This command will globally install the CacheServer package, making it available for use across your system.
